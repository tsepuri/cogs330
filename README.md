# The role of associative memory inhibition in language switching

The paper I wrote using this code linked [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LYfAedQM9Or-EXixGsNyCUgi5l-qwhFx/view?usp=sharing)

data_extraction.R directly extracts the data from [Ap≈°valka et al. (2022)](https://github.com/dcdace/Domain-general/tree/master) and outputs them to the .csv files in the repo. Those .csv fies are then used by bayes_network.ipynb to create the Bayesian networks.
